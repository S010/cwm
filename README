cwm is a lightweight and efficient window manager for X.

More information is available in the manpage (see the cwm.1.html file
in this directory).


This is a mirror of OpenBSD's cwm which has been made to compile and
work on GNU/Linux.

There are also other slight deviations from OpenBSD source tree
concerning functionality. I'm not listing them here because in the
future they might get incorporated into OpenBSD source tree.
