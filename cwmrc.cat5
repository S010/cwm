     ccwwmmrrcc - calm window manager configuration file

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     This manual page describes the cwm(1) configuration file.

     The current line can be extended over multiple lines using a backslash
     (`\').  Comments can be put anywhere in the file using a hash mark (`#'),
     and extend to the end of the current line.  Care should be taken when
     commenting out multi-line text: the comment is effective until the end of
     the entire block.

     Arguments containing whitespace should be surrounded by double quotes
     (").

     The following options are accepted:

     aauuttooggrroouupp _g_r_o_u_p _w_i_n_d_o_w_n_a_m_e
     aauuttooggrroouupp _g_r_o_u_p _w_i_n_d_o_w_n_a_m_e_,_w_i_n_d_o_w_c_l_a_s_s
             Control automatic window grouping, based on the name and/or class
             properties, where _g_r_o_u_p is a number between 0 and 9.  If the
             group number is 0, then the window will not be grouped; this to
             allow for ``sticky'' windows in sticky group mode.

             The name and class of a window may be obtained using xprop(1).

     bbiinndd _k_e_y_s _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
             Cause the creation of a keybinding, or replacement of a default
             keybinding.  The modifier keys come first, followed by a `-'.

             The following modifiers are recognised:

                   C       The Control key.
                   M       The Meta key.
                   S       The Shift key.
                   4       The Mod4 key (normally the windows key).

             The `-' should be followed by either a keysym name, taken from
             _/_u_s_r_/_X_1_1_R_6_/_i_n_c_l_u_d_e_/_X_1_1_/_k_e_y_s_y_m_d_e_f_._h, or a numerical keycode value
             enclosed in ``[]''.  The _c_o_m_m_a_n_d may either be one from the _B_I_N_D
             _C_O_M_M_A_N_D _L_I_S_T (see below) or the command line that is to be
             executed.

             A special _c_o_m_m_a_n_d keyword ``unmap'' can be used to remove the
             named keybinding.  This can be used to remove a binding which
             conflicts with an application.

     bboorrddeerrwwiiddtthh _p_i_x_e_l_s
             Set the window border width to _p_i_x_e_l_s.

     ccoolloorr aaccttiivveebboorrddeerr _c_o_l_o_r
             Set the color of the active border.

     ccoolloorr ggrroouuppbboorrddeerr _c_o_l_o_r
             Set the color of the border while grouping a window.

     ccoolloorr iinnaaccttiivveebboorrddeerr _c_o_l_o_r
             Set the color of the inactive border.

     ccoolloorr uunnggrroouuppbboorrddeerr _c_o_l_o_r
             Set the color of the border while ungrouping a window.

     ccoommmmaanndd _n_a_m_e _p_a_t_h
             Every _n_a_m_e entry is shown in the application menu.  When
             selected, the defined _p_a_t_h is executed with execve(2).

             The _n_a_m_e entries tteerrmm and lloocckk have a special meaning.  They
             point to the terminal and screen locking programs specified by
             keybindings.  The defaults are xterm(1) and xlock(1),
             respectively.

     ffoonnttnnaammee _f_o_n_t
             Change the default _f_o_n_t for Xft(3).

     ggaapp _t_o_p _b_o_t_t_o_m _l_e_f_t _r_i_g_h_t
             Define a ``gap'' in pixels at the edge of the screen, so that
             when a window is maximized it will not overlap this area.  This
             ``gap'' can be used for applications such as xclock(1), where the
             user may wish to remain visible.

     iiggnnoorree _w_i_n_d_o_w_n_a_m_e
             Ignore, and do not warp to, windows with the name _w_i_n_d_o_w_n_a_m_e when
             drawing borders and cycling through windows.

     mmoouusseebbiinndd _b_u_t_t_o_n_s _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
             Cause the creation of a mouse binding, or replacement of a
             default mouse binding.  The modifier keys come first, followed by
             a `-'.

             The following modifiers are recognised:

                   C       The Control key.
                   M       The Meta key.
                   S       The Shift key.
                   4       The Mod4 key (normally the windows key).

             The `-' should be followed by number:

                   1       Left mouse button.
                   2       Middle mouse button.
                   3       Right mouse button.

             The _c_o_m_m_a_n_d may be taken from the _M_O_U_S_E_B_I_N_D _C_O_M_M_A_N_D _L_I_S_T (see
             below).

     mmoovveeaammoouunntt _p_i_x_e_l_s
             Set a default size for the keyboard movement bindings, in pixels.
             The default is 1.

     ssttiicckkyy yyeess|nnoo
             Toggle sticky group mode.  The default behavior for new windows
             is to not assign any group.  By enabling sticky group mode,
             cwm(1) will assign new windows to the currently selected group.
